Idea proposed by Srikripaa S. 57

## 1. Introduction / Need of the project
The COLLEGE EVENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (CEMS) is a system which can be used for maintaining the records of all the events that are being conducted and of all the students that are participating in that event. This system is created using the swing class of JAVA at the frontend and PostgreSQL at the backend.

This system allows event heads to conviniently create and update their event.

>CEMS can be used for the following purposes by the event head:
>- For creation of event
>- Advertisement/Publicity of Event
>- To maintain a list of students, with their name, numbers, prn, branch, year and amount given, that have participated in their event
>- To get a list of requests of participation in their event.

CEMS is the best tool for event heads to use for a hassle-free event management.

>Along with the event heads, it is also useful for the students in the college because of the following reasons:
>- The students now do not have to remember or note down the events they’ve participated in!!!
>- They get a list of all the events that are being conducted in the college, rather than coming to know about it, one by one.
>- Students get a separate list of who their partners are in each event.
>- They can also update their information
>- Sending requests to events for participation has become easy with CEMS!

## 2. Basic features
**For event heads:**
- Ability to create event
- Ability to update event
- Insertion and deletion of student from event is provided
- List of requests for participation in event provided
- Ability given to event head to form groups of students
- Alert given to event head when:
  - Team limit exceeded – Event head trying to insert a student beyond number of people allowed in a team.
  - You haven’t registered – Insertion of student who has not registered.
  - Group ID doesn’t exist – When Event head selects “Not new group”, but enters a non-existing group id.
  - Data already exists in table – When the event head tries to insert a student that has already taken part in the event.
  - Please select the row you want to delete – When event head clicks the delete button
  - Deletion Confirmation Box

**For Students:**
- Ability to see the list of events they have participated in.
- Sending requests for participation is possible through CEMS.
- Students can see who their partners are in their team and in which event.
- List of events is provided to students. So that they don’t get to know about it one by one, which causes inconvenience.
- Secure Forgot password mechanism: Allows the head to change their password, but with security. A mail is sent with a unique OTP. If the OTP is invalid, an alert will be given.
